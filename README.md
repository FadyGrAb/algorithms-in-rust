# Algorithms in Rust
I always wanted to read about algorithms. I've picked up "[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)" by *Aditya Y. Bhargava* and it was the perfect first algorithms book for me! It's easy, simple, and fun!  
It uses *[Python](https://www.python.org/)* to demonstrate how those algorithms work. But I'd like to consider myself well *knowledgeable* of Python. It happens that I was learning *[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)* while I was reading the book, so, why don't I make it a bit challenging for me and implement those algorithms in Rust?!  
So, I've created this repo to serve as the Rust implementation for most the algorithms mentioned in the book. I won't go into details and explain how each algorithm work, I'll only implement it in Rust.  
Keep in mind that I'm still learning Rust so the code here might not be the most elegant Rust code but I'm doing my best! ;)
